## SQL Analytics Projects

This repository contains SQL queries demonstrating how I approach
data analysis, reporting, and metric validation in a data warehouse environment.

**Skills demonstrated:**
- Complex joins and CTEs
- Window functions
- Business-focused reporting queries
- Clear documentation and assumptions

Each query is written with accuracy, readability, and stakeholder use in mind.
